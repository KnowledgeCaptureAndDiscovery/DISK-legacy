A hypothesis pattern, which represents the type of hypotheses that can be explored with this line of inquiry.  An example of a hypothesis pattern is “Protein ?p is associated with cancer ?c”.  This hypothesis pattern must be expressed in the same language as hypothesis statements, so that they can be matched against a user’s hypothesis.\r\n2. A set of query patterns, representing the kinds of data relevant to testing the hypothesis pattern as a set of templates of queries to a data repository.  Several kinds of data may be relevant, so there may be several query patterns.  For example, “Retrieve data of mass spectrometry experiments of tumor samples from patients with cancer ?c”.  \r\n3. A set of workflows, which capture data analysis methods that can be applied to the data retrieved by the query patterns in order to test the hypothesis pattern.  For example, a workflow to analyze mass spectrometry data could include steps such as matching proteins from either a patient’s custom database or on a reference human proteomic database to tandem mass spectrometry data.\r\n4. A set of workflow mappings, indicating how the query patterns and the datasets retrieved should be used to instantiate the workflows above to create execution-ready workflows.  \r\n5. A set of meta-workflows, which describe how to aggregate the results of the workflow executions done to analyze the data.  For example, suppose that one of the workflows in the line of inquiry is for analyzing protein mass spectrometry data for n patients finding evidence for the protein ?p with a p-value p1 and another workflow is for protein fluorescence data for m patients giving a p-value p1, then the meta-workflow would indicate how to combine that evidence into a joint confidence value.\r\n6. A set of meta-workflow mappings, which describe how the results of the workflow executions are to be used to generate bindings for the inputs of the meta-workflows.\r\n7. A set of priorities, which describe the relative importance of running different execution-ready workflows given the hypothesis at hand"@en ;
